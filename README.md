## How to Reproduce Our Results  

Below are the steps that must be followed to reproduce the results associated with this tool. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with explanations on how to use its contents:  
1. Preprocessing the study city data: [CityData](https://github.com/fabinader/open_ran_datacenter_placement/tree/test-campaigns-plots/CityData);  
2. Creating the simulation campaign: [Campaigns](https://github.com/fabinader/open_ran_datacenter_placement/tree/test-campaigns-plots/Campaigns);  
3. Plotting the results: [PlotScripts](https://github.com/fabinader/open_ran_datacenter_placement/tree/test-campaigns-plots/PlotScripts).  

The file `odc_placement_parser.py` is the simulation algorithm and must always remain in the repository's root folder.
